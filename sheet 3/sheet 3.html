                <b>Personal computers</b></a>
                 , also known as PCs, are the least powerful, yet the most widely used
            and fastest-growing type of computer. There are five types of personal computers:
            <i>desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones, and wearables.</i>

                <b>Desktop computers</b></a>
                are small enough to fit on top of or alongside a desk yet are too big to carry around.

                <b>Tablets</b></a>
                also known as <b>tablet computers</b>, are smaller, lighter, and
                generally less powerful than laptops. Like a laptop, tablets have a flat screen but typically
                do not have a standard keyboard. Instead, tablets typically use a virtual keyboard that
                appears on the screen and is touch-sensitive.

                <b>Smartphones</b></a>
                are the most widely used personal computer. Smartphones are cell phones
                with wireless connections to the Internet and processing capabilities. Other mobile
                computers include wearable devices like Appleâ€™s Watch.
